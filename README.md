# MWO Battle Center
This project is designed with the intent of offering teams that play MWO in coordinated drops the ability to both manage their rosters but also organize their drops so that running these drops is easier and less stressful.

# Features
* Ability to manage a roster.
* Ability to both gauge potential attendance and track actual attendance for a series of drops.
* Ability to create drop decs for drops within a series as well as manage alternate drop decs.
* Ability for pilots to manage their mech specialties and "hangar".
* Ability to see histories of drops based on a variety of qualities (teams, maps, players).
